Hey there! I'm Jared Connor. Someone who is attempting to etch out a piece of this digital world, through writing, code, and ideas. 

I'm focused on searching for technologies that drive for economic optimization. This implies understanding technology trends that lead to sustained growth. Along with personal strategies that improve one's personal efficiency and ideas. 

I'm a financial analyst for the treasury department at [Umpqua Bank](https://www.umpquabank.com/), on the team that runs their interest rate risk reporting. Also, I'm currently enrolled at [Oregon State's](https://oregonstate.edu/) studying computer science. Before that, I studied economics and philosophy at [The University of Oregon](https://www.uoregon.edu/). 

In my free time, I love reading, tinkering on new side projects, and building things. When I need a break from thinking, I'm exploring the Pacific Northwest, reading, running, or spending time with my family. 

This blog is an attempt to openly learn. I learn best when I have to explain them to other people. I want this space to act as a quasi public peripheral brain while also acting as a place to share what I've learned.
