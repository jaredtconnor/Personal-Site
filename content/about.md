Hey there! My name is Jared Connor. I like to frame myself as someone who is attempting to etch out a piece of this digital world through writing, in both word and through analysis (i.e. code or mathematics).

I'm overly focused with searching for technologies that push for economic optimization, which implies understanding technology trends that lead to sustained growth. This is paired with personal strategies that improve one's personal efficiency. 

As of late, I'm a financial analyst for the Treasury at [Umpqua Bank](https://www.umpquabank.com/), specifically on the team that runs their interest rate risk reporting. 

For learning, I'm currently enrolled in [Oregon State's](https://oregonstate.edu/) post-bacc program in computer science. 

Before that, I studied economics and philosophy at [The University of Oregon](https://www.uoregon.edu/). 

In my free time, I love reading, tinkering on new side projects, building things, and running. When I need a break for thinking, I'm exploring the Pacific Northwest, snowbarding, surfing, or spending time with my family. 

This blog is an attempt to openly learn. I learn best when I have to explain them to other people. In addition, I want this space to act as a quasi public peripheral brain while also acting as a place to share what I've learned. Some of the best pieces on the internet are from niche, small, personal blogs that take an entirely new spin on things you have though of yourself.
