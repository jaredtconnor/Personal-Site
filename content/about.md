Hey there! My name is Jared. I am a financial analyst working for [Umpqua Bank](https://www.umpquabank.com/) in Portland, Oregon. Here you can find my writings on all things ranging from economics, finance, philosophy, software development, and data infrastructures. This blog is a hope to publish and distribute information in the aim towards _small improvements_ (based upon [Tyler Cowen's](https://marginalrevolution.com/)) ideas of a marginal revolution towards a better world.
