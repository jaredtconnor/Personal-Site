## Emissions impact of the merge 

I listened to a great Economist podcast, [Babbage - *How Ethereumâ€™s merge could transform crypto*](https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2022/09/13/how-ethereums-merge-could-transform-crypto). It discusses the upcoming merge and structual shift in the Ethereum block chain. While I don't consider myself a die-hard crypto follower, this seems like a fairly big deal, so I want to cover some of the details from a high level and the downstream econoimc impacts. For this, I'll assume a minimum requisite level of understanding of blockchains and cryptocurrencies.  

Ethereum has previously assumed the [Proof of Work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work) paradigm where actors solidified transactions within the blockchain by proving some requisite amount of work was performed, typically by solving cryptographic problems by way of GPU processing. This, almost by definition, uses energy as a direct input which is ultimately wasted to show that a agent operating within the system as correctly verified the information being added. As this scales, which has been observed and critiqued rather publicly for the downstream environmental impacts, the sheer amount of power consumption is quite drastic.

The Bitcoin network amounts to a projected 72 Metric Tons of $CO2$ emissions, on part with the emissions output of Greece.
