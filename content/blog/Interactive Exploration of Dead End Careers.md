I read [this](https://www.zippia.com/research/dead-end-careers/) wonderful analysis,
originally posted by [Zippia](https://www.zippia.com/about-us/) on the dynamics of
salaries across age and labor demographics, via the _PUMS (Public
Use Microdata Sample)_ for you acronym junkies out there. While they attempted to view
so called __dead end jobs__, which they roughly define as jobs that lack little
wage growth later in their lives, the analysis illustrates a developing trend - the
gradual widening of the high skill/high wage labor and low skill/low wage/service oriented
labor.
