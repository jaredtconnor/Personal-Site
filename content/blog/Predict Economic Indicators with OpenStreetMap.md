[This](https://janakiev.com/blog/osm-predict-economic-indicators/) was a really cool article regarding the use of [OpenStreeMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org)
to predict the economic potential and output of a country. Specifically he is using
publicly labeled tags and indicators of schools, universities, lamp posts, and
post offices to see how much production and economic activity is coming from a
specific region!

This could be of great use for economic research in countries where reliable data is a problem
or to view competitive economies from a bird's eye view (_no pun intended_).
