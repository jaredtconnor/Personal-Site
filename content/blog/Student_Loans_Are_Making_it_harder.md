It is pretty well known that the outstanding college debt burden is surging and having spill over
effects on individual's choices. Per a [Federal Reserve Report](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/consumer-community-context-201901.pdf), _36 percent of individuals aged 24-32 owned homes in 2014, down from the 
reported 45 percent in 2004_. I read [this](https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/how-student-loan-debt-is-destroying-marriages) article discussing the effects of co-signing for a partner's college debt.

As the burden of debt increases in both size and the number of effected individuals, the decision for one
to marry into one's debt burden might increasingly be a sticking point for young couples. Take this example of [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/StudentLoans/comments/906pfi/fiance_has_390000_in_student_loan_debt_how_on/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) couple, where their spouse had $390,000 in student debt. Granted, love is sometimes outside of the bounds of rationality, but can you argue that in terms of a potential partner's debt burden?
