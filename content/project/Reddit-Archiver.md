This was basic a [CRUD](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CRUD) application built with Python and [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) we created in my [Intro to Databases](https://ecampus.oregonstate.edu/soc/ecatalog/ecoursedetail.htm?subject=CS&coursenumber=340&termcode=all) course. The actual implemenetation of the app wasn't too complex, utilizing Bootstrap 5 and a form get/post pattern to update values.
