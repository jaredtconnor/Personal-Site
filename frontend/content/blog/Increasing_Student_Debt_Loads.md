[Student Loans A Lot Like The Subprime Mortgage Debacle, Watchdog Says](https://www.npr.org/2019/12/09/785527874/student-loans-a-lot-like-the-subprime-mortgage-debacle-watchdog-says) - From NPR

While I do believe that comments about "the next thing to blow up the economy" are undue, the amount of student debt and it's rate of growth are unsustainable for long.

> "Michael McPherson is an economist and former college president who studies higher education financing. "I think of a crisis as being a situation which is getting rapidly worse," he says. That's not what's happening with student loans, McPherson says."

It could be a slow burning crisis, where there isn't an entire implosion of the aggregate demand due to the tightening credit cycle, but rather a sustained lower level of demand decreasing the real growth rate over a prolonged period of time.
