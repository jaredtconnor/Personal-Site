Nearly anything that Tyler Cowen touches is filled to the Brim with nuggets of insight, but this piece takes the cake
for being the most comprehensive categorization of his thoughts on moral philosophy, economics, how one should order themselves
in the current economy and so on.</p><p>It seems fitting that Robin Wiblin would be the person to incite such a conversation. He&rsquo;s from the
<a href=https://80000hours.org>80,000 Hours</a> organization, whom I first stumbled upon during my senior year
in undergrad. They take a pragmatic approach at difficult questions in the aim to provide younger
or recent graduates with the tools to decide where and how to have a positive impact on the world.
As strong proponents towards the Effective Altruism movement, they take a philosophical approach to
answering <em>how one should live their life in practicality</em> (though I believe Tyler has been recently
critical of this movement).</p><p>They discuss topics from Tyler&rsquo;s <a href=https://www.amazon.com/Stubborn-Attachments-Prosperous-Responsible-Individuals/dp/1732265135>Stubborn Attachments</a>
book including:</p><ul><li>Tyler&rsquo;s (interesting) obsession with economic growth as the moral imperative to aim in favor for</li><li>The ability to and whether we should discount the future of possible outcomes</li><li>Current trends in economics and research themes that would aim towards misrepresented & under served issues</li><li>The tradeoff between economic growth and the eventual military-industrial complex that could pose possible existential risks</li><li>Tyler&rsquo;s (weird) pessimism for space and it&rsquo;s commercialization</li></ul></div></article><footer id=footer><div class=footer-left>Copyright &copy; 2020 Jared C.</div><div class=footer-right><nav><ul><li><a href=/>Home</a></li><li><a href=/blog>Writings</a></li><li><a href=/tags>Tags</a></li><li><a href=/about>About</a></li></ul></nav></div></footer></div></body><link rel=stylesheet href=/lib/font-awesome/css/all.min.css><script src=/lib/jquery/jquery.min.js></script><script src=/js/main.js></script></html>
