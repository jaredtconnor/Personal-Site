Here you can find my writings on all things ranging from economics, finance, writing, philosophy, and computers. I love reasoning about changes that can have marginal improvements on both the micro and macro scale.">

<p>Well it&rsquo;s awesome to see that you&rsquo;ve found it here. After quite some time, I finally was able to publish this via <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>. That was a headache in itself because Github pages and Hugo don&rsquo;t play nicely with each other, but nonetheless.</p>
<p>So this site is going to hold basically everything I&rsquo;m working on and want everyone to see. Publishing content is a great thing to do in the age where your website/blog basically is your new business card. Sounds corny, I know but there are remnants of truth in that statement. Additionally, I&rsquo;m attempting to setup a place where I can <em>store</em> thoughts for later use. Take the wonderful <a href="https://chrisalbon.com">Chris Albon</a> for example. He&rsquo;s setup a personal site that acts as a storage device for not only project, but snippets of code, mathematical concepts, machine learning algorithms, and all the likes. In the field of medicine, many are known to do such a <a href="http://brainblogger.com/2009/03/09/relying-on-a-peripheral-brain/">thing</a>) due to the vast amount of information they are required to retain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Peripheral brain: any hardware containing vast amounts of information, which is in constant flux and is important to the owner but not so important as to be stored in wetware.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are many blogs like this ran by stunning intellectuals that provide the same benefit. Take Tyler Cowen&rsquo;s <a href="http://marginalrevolution.com">Marginal Revolution</a>. For nearly every day of the week, he is posting interesting articles, book review&rsquo;s adn recommendations, thoughts on policy, current events, and modern/historical economic theories. His blog is truly a masterpiece.</p>
<p>The goal of this blog is to display links, articles, and thoughts corresponding to information that I&rsquo;m digesting on a daily or weekly basis. I&rsquo;ve never been a big fan of social media and the publicity that it receives, so sectioning off a small section of the vast web could be a viable space to display everything. As of right now, I have no set agenda or topics to cover with content. <em>Forewarning</em>, articles and posts will likely be related to financial, economic, technology, philosophy, and statistics right now, simply because that&rsquo;s what I find myself interested in at the current time. But think very well (and likely will) could change.</p>
<p>As of right now, I haven&rsquo;t came up with a name for the blog. Nick Szabo&rsquo;s <a href="http://unenumerated.blogspot.com">Unenumerated</a> is a dream title for a blog of that caliber. Should mine be <strong>Implied Powers</strong>? <strong>Syneídēsis</strong> (it&rsquo;s Greek for consciousness)? Something philosophy based or should it be economics/technology based? It&rsquo;s yet to be determined, nor does it need to be right now.</p>
