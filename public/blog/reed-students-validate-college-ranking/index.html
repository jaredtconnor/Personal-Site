    <p>I came across this great article about a group of Reed students in a statistics course that reverse engineered the <a href="https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges">US News College Ranking System</a> in oder to determine if Reed was being penalized by not filling out info for the the proprietary ranking system. How did they validated it? Statistics of course.</p>

<p>They noted that without being able to derive the statistical model it is uncertain to determine if schools are being properly ranked and there is significant errors with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_sum_model">weighted-sum model</a> (Clarke 2004). As such, they decided to reverse engineer a model to predict school rankings. In doing so, with nearly 94% accuracy, they illustrate that Reed College is the only outlier in predictions, indicating that they might be reaping the penalty by not playing by the games of US News. Regardless, it&rsquo;s amazing real world statistics and very thoroughly done. Well done <a href="https://github.com/huayingq1996">Huaying Qiu</a> and Wenxin Du.</p>
