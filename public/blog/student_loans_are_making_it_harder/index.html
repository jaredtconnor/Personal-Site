<meta property="og:description" content="It is pretty well known that the outstanding college debt burden is surging and having spill over effects on individual&rsquo;s choices. Per a Federal Reserve Report, 36 percent of individuals aged 24-32 owned homes in 2014, down from the reported 45 percent in 2004.

As the burden of debt increases in both size and the number of effected individuals, the decision for one to marry into one&rsquo;s debt burden might increasingly be a sticking point for young couples." />

    <p>It is pretty well known that the outstanding college debt burden is surging and having spill over
effects on individual&rsquo;s choices. Per a <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/consumer-community-context-201901.pdf">Federal Reserve Report</a>, <em>36 percent of individuals aged 24-32 owned homes in 2014, down from the
reported 45 percent in 2004</em>. I read <a href="https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/how-student-loan-debt-is-destroying-marriages">this</a> article discussing the effects of co-signing for a partner&rsquo;s college debt.</p>
<p>As the burden of debt increases in both size and the number of effected individuals, the decision for one
to marry into one&rsquo;s debt burden might increasingly be a sticking point for young couples. Take this example of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StudentLoans/comments/906pfi/fiance_has_390000_in_student_loan_debt_how_on/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x">this</a> couple, where their spouse had $390,000 in student debt. Granted, love is sometimes outside of the bounds of rationality, but can you argue that in terms of a potential partner&rsquo;s debt burden?</p>
