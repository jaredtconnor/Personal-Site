This importantly requires the mother to spend more time with the newborn. As our brains became more energy expensive some 500,000 years ago, the currency of evolution, we required more energy rich foods (e.g. meats) to support that. The father served, and was evolutionarily rewarded with the spreading of his genes (as children who died early were not able to), as the main breadwinner and then teacher as the child grew into a young adult. While a mom-child relationship is genetically predisposed to simulate a protective and compassionate bond, the fathers acts more as an outward facing and rearing bond to protect and prepare the child for what lies ahead, and to teach them how to succeed.</p><p>Give it a read! I&rsquo;m starting to enjoy these evolutionary arguments and narratives more and more.</p></div></article><footer id=footer><div class=footer-left>Copyright &copy; 2020 Jared C.</div><div class=footer-right><nav><ul><li><a href=/>Home</a></li><li><a href=/blog>Writings</a></li><li><a href=/tags>Tags</a></li><li><a href=/about>About</a></li></ul></nav></div></footer></div></body><link rel=stylesheet href=/lib/font-awesome/css/all.min.css><script src=/lib/jquery/jquery.min.js></script><script src=/js/main.js></script></html>
