      <description>Gregory Mankiw recently provided his take on MMT in A Skepticâ€™s Guide to Modern Monetary Theory. There has been a lot of hype around this modern take on macroeconomics which has been pitched as a fix for the current monetary regime that policy makers currently hold.
In it, Makiw provides his take on the movement&amp;rsquo;s salient points. In summary, MMT takes the stand that:
1) A government that is responsible for printing it&amp;rsquo;s own currency can never be subject to budget constraints due to the ability to create more currency.</description>

      <description>Student Loans A Lot Like The Subprime Mortgage Debacle, Watchdog Says - From NPR
While I do believe that comments about &amp;ldquo;the next thing to blow up the economy&amp;rdquo; are undue, the amount of student debt and it&amp;rsquo;s rate of growth are unsustainable for long.
 &amp;ldquo;Michael McPherson is an economist and former college president who studies higher education financing. &amp;ldquo;I think of a crisis as being a situation which is getting rapidly worse,&amp;rdquo; he says.</description>

      <title>College debt is making it harder for people to get married</title>

      <description>It is pretty well known that the outstanding college debt burden is surging and having spill over effects on individual&amp;rsquo;s choices. Per a Federal Reserve Report, 36 percent of individuals aged 24-32 owned homes in 2014, down from the reported 45 percent in 2004. I read this article discussing the effects of co-signing for a partner&amp;rsquo;s college debt.
As the burden of debt increases in both size and the number of effected individuals, the decision for one to marry into one&amp;rsquo;s debt burden might increasingly be a sticking point for young couples.</description>

      <description>Questions About Economics I was lucky enough to be asked by one of my favorite undergrad professors, Ed Whitelaw, to come back down to Eugene to speak on a panel of his past students to speak. The topic included a career day regarding economics and what such an education means in the real world. Here are a number of the questions and my associated answers:
 What economic tools/fields do you see as most critical to careers in your area?</description>

      <title>Conversations with Tyler: Robin Wiblin from 80000 Hours</title>

      <description>I feel fairly comfortable stating that this is my favorite podcast of the year. Nearly anything that Tyler Cowen touches is filled to the Brim with nuggets of insight, but this piece takes the cake for being the most comprehensive categorization of his thoughts on moral philosophy, economics, how one should order themselves in the current economy and so on.
It seems fitting that Robin Wiblin would be the person to incite such a conversation.</description>

      <title>Predict Economics Indicators with OpenStreetMap</title>
      <link>https://www.jaredtconnor.com/blog/predict-economic-indicators-with-openstreetmap/</link>

      <description>This was a really cool article regarding the use of OpenStreeMap to predict the economic potential and output of a country. Specifically he is using publicly labeled tags and indicators of schools, universities, lamp posts, and post offices to see how much production and economic activity is coming from a specific region!
This could be of great use for economic research in countries where reliable data is a problem or to view competitive economies from a bird&amp;rsquo;s eye view (no pun intended).</description>
