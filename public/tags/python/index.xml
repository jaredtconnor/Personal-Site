      <description>Classes and Programming Paradigms for Python Programming paradigms, at least in my case of teaching myself programming, was something that I didn&amp;rsquo;t stress but should have. While programming requires the use of writing code in a specific language&amp;rsquo;s syntax, its more so a manner to distill a problem into a procedure to attempt to arrive at a solution. All that said, these paradigms are different ways to solve problems.</description>

      <description>Understanding Pandas in Python: This was one of my first projects in python to understand data frames. Anyone interested in data analysis with Python needs to understand how to use, manipulate, and structure data in ways that are useful and required for your analysis. Thankfully, there are some incredibly smart developers in this world that understand the importance of this task, so they developed the [Pandas]() package. On top of that, we can use the ever useful [BeautifulSoup]() package, which allows us to make automated scripts to interact with HTML backed webpages.</description>
