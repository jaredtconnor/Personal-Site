      <description>I came across this great article about a group of Reed students in a statistics course that reverse engineered the US News College Ranking System in oder to determine if Reed was being penalized by not filling out info for the the proprietary ranking system.

They noted that without being able to derive the statistical model it is uncertain to determine if schools are being properly ranked and there is significant errors with a weighted-sum model (Clarke 2004).</description>
