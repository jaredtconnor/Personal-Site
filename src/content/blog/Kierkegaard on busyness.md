# Kierkegaard on Boredom and Busyness:

This was a great article about [Soren Kierkegaard's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Søren_Kierkegaard) discourse
on being busy. This article is incredibly easy to resonate with. Opposed to wallowing in the modern
competitiveness of _keeping up with the Jones_, one should realize the drive for one to be busy
as an indication of spinning their wheels to no ultimate aim or end.  

A short passage from the article:

>For Kierkegaard, busy people are experiencing something indeterminate because their activities are not directed towards some particular good. The busy person may seem busy with some specific activity. In the case of the agricultural example in the passage above, the busy person appears busy with sowing and harvesting. The busy person sows and harvests and rests upon these gains. But what is the purpose of this rest? Only to begin once more, for “busyness harvests over and over again.” There is nothing gained by the cycle other than rest from the labor it requires. Since there is nothing definite gained by this busyness, we can characterize it as involving something indefinite—just like anxiety and boredom.

Keep your feelers up folks.
