Hey there, I'm Jared! 

For a bit of my background, I've worked as an analyst in the finance and banking industry previously  with a background in economics. Concurrently, I've been studying computer science and software engineering.

## Strongly held mutable opinions

A list of important axioms and opinions that frame my thinking:

1 - The labor market is a powerful optimization tool that one should never lose track of in terms of skills obtained and the list of things to learn.

2 - There is a paradox between the onset of information technology/computers and increased productivity. [1](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/cs201/projects/productivity-paradox/background.html)

3 - Order emerges in the steady-states of non-equilibrium systems.
